Project Context and Technical Overview
1. Project Goal
We are building an AI-based bug reporting and job improvement suggestion chatbot. This product aims to provide a seamless way for end-users within a tenant's application to report bugs and offer suggestions for job role improvements directly through an interactive chatbot interface. The target platforms are similar to existing tools like Marker.io, Canny, Nolt, and Upvoty.

2. Deployment Strategy
The primary deployment strategy, and the initial focus of our discussion, is to serve the chatbot as a React-based embeddable widget via a Universal Module Definition (UMD) script. This allows tenants to easily integrate the widget into their existing websites by simply including a <script> tag and a target <div>. Other potential deployment methods include a direct React NPM package and an iframe, but the UMD script is prioritized for its accessibility.

3. Key Technical Challenges & Solutions Discussed
Our conversation has revolved around several critical aspects of building such an embeddable widget, particularly concerning data transfer, security, and integration:

Data Transfer (Tenant to Widget):

Initial Configuration: Basic, non-sensitive tenant-specific data (e.g., data-tenant-id) can be passed via data-* attributes on the script tag or the target div.

Dynamic User/Tenant Information: For sensitive or user-specific data (e.g., user ID, name, email, roles, custom tenant data), a JSON Web Token (JWT) is the chosen mechanism. The tenant's backend will generate a JWT containing these claims, sign it with a secret key, and pass it to the tenant's frontend. The tenant's frontend then passes this JWT to our widget's initialization function.

Security (Secrets, Spam, Feature Copying):

API Key/App Identifier Exposure: Tenant API keys or app identifiers should not be exposed directly in the client-side script. Instead, these identifiers (e.g., tenantId) are passed to the widget, which then includes them in requests to our backend. The actual secure validation and mapping of tenantId to internal secrets happens on our backend.

Preventing Unauthorized Use/Spam: The JWT is crucial here. When our widget sends data to our backend, it includes the JWT. Our backend must validate the JWT's signature, expiration, issuer, and audience using the secret key known only to us and the tenant's backend. This ensures the data originates from a legitimate tenant and user. Rate limiting and abuse detection on our backend are also essential.

Preventing Feature Copying: While complete prevention is impossible for client-side code, strategies include:

Obfuscation: Making the client-side code harder to read (limited effectiveness).

Backend-Dependent Features: Ensuring core functionality (e.g., bug submission, AI processing) relies heavily on our secure backend APIs. Copying the frontend code without access to our backend provides limited value.

Value Proposition: Emphasizing the continuous improvement, support, and backend intelligence (AI) that a direct copy cannot replicate.

Legal Agreements: Terms of Service that prohibit unauthorized use or reverse engineering.

Building the Script (UMD Bundle):

Bundling Tools: We will use modern JavaScript bundlers like Vite (recommended for simplicity and speed), Webpack, or Rollup to create a single UMD (.umd.js) file. This file will contain our React widget and its dependencies.

Global Initialization Function: The UMD bundle will expose a global function (e.g., window.MyBugWidget.init) that the host page calls. This function receives configuration (including the target DOM element selector, tenantId, and jwtAuthToken).

Dynamic Script Loading: The widget's main script will be loaded asynchronously by a small, synchronous "shim" or "stub" script provided to the tenant.

Passing User Information from Tenant:

The tenant's backend generates a JWT with user claims (e.g., userId, userName, customData).

The tenant's frontend passes this jwtAuthToken to our widget's init function.

Our widget includes this jwtAuthToken in API calls to our backend.

Our backend validates the JWT and extracts user/tenant information from the validated payload.

Initialization Script (Shim/Stub):

A small, synchronous JavaScript snippet is provided to the tenant.

This shim defines a temporary global object (e.g., window.MyBugWidget) with a queue (q) and an init method that pushes arguments onto the queue.

It then dynamically injects the <script> tag for the main UMD bundle asynchronously.

When the main UMD bundle loads, it overwrites the shim, processes any queued calls, and then handles all subsequent calls directly. This prevents race conditions and ensures calls are not lost.

Styling Isolation:

CSS Modules: For component-scoped styles, using *.module.css files generates unique class names to prevent global conflicts.

CSS-in-JS Libraries: Solutions like Styled Components or Emotion provide robust style encapsulation.

vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js: A Vite plugin that injects CSS directly into the JavaScript bundle, simplifying deployment and avoiding separate CSS files.

Shadow DOM (via Web Components): For the strongest isolation, rendering the React widget within a Shadow DOM (using libraries like react-to-webcomponent) can completely isolate its styles and DOM from the host page.
